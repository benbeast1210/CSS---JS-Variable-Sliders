# CSS---JS-Variable-Sliders

## Overview
> This site features a number of sliders that control how an image is displayed. The larger purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use JS to give any
> user the ability to change certain CSS elements on a given page. The primary advantage to implementing the scripting within the CSS is that the changes a
> user makes are displayed back to them in real time. Using SASS, one may also give the user control to edit elements, however these changes are only
> visually apparent after compiling. Using JS inside of the CSS makes for a much smoother UX.
